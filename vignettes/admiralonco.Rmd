# Introduction

As this is a package extension, if you are new to `{admiral}` then the best
place to first start reading would be the [Get
Started](https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiral/articles/admiral.html) page. This
extension package follows the same main idea and conventions, and re-uses many
functions from `{admiral}`, so it is important to thoroughly understand these to
be able to use `{admiralonco}`.

# Creating Oncology ADaM Datasets

For the oncology ADaM data structures, an overview of the flow and example function calls
for the most common steps are provided by the following vignettes:

- [Creating a Basic ADRS](adrs_basic.html)
- [Creating ADRS (Including Non-standard Endpoints)](adrs.html)
- [Creating ADTTE](adtte.html)
- [Creating ADTR](adtr.html)

`{admiralonco}` also provides template R scripts as a starting point. They can be
created by calling `use_ad_template()` from `{admiral}`, e.g.,

```{r}
library(admiral)
```

```r
use_ad_template(
  adam_name = "adrs",
  save_path = "./ad_adrs.R",
  package = "admiralonco"
)
```

A list of all available templates can be obtained by `list_all_templates()`
from `{admiral}`:

```{r}
list_all_templates(package = "admiralonco")
```
