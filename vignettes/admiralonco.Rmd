# Introduction

As this is a package extension, if you are new to `{admiral}` then the best place to first start
reading would be this `r dyn_link("Get Started", admiral_homepage, "articles/admiral.html")`
guide. This extension package follows the same main idea and conventions, and re-uses many
functions from `{admiral}`, so it is important to thoroughly understand these to be able to
use `{admiralonco}`.

# Derivations

The most important functions in `{admiralonco}` are the
[derivations](../reference/index.html#section-derivations). Again these follow the same
conventions as `{admiral}` but are focused to oncology-specific needs.

# Starting a Script

For the oncology ADaM data structures, an overview of the flow and example function calls
for the most common steps are provided by the following vignettes:

- [Creating a Basic ADRS](adrs_basic.html)
- [Creating ADRS (Including Non-standard Endpoints)](adrs.html)
- [Creating ADTTE](adtte.html)
- [Creating ADTR](adtr.html)

`{admiralonco}` also provides template R scripts as a starting point. They can be
created by calling `use_ad_template()` from {admiral}, e.g.,

```{r}
library(admiral)
```

```r
use_ad_template(
  adam_name = "adrs",
  save_path = "./ad_adrs.R",
  package = "admiralonco"
)
```

A list of all available templates can be obtained by `list_all_templates()`
from {admiral}:

```{r}
list_all_templates(package = "admiralonco")
```
